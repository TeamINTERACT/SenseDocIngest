These scripts are used to support the SenseDoc ingest protocol described in Protocol.md.

Since ingesting involves working with the ground-truth data, which is messy, fragile, and crucial to the mission, the process is structured as an inherently manual one. This ensures that the ingest operator is paying full attention to the data and the steps of the process, and can respond appropriately if any new wrinkles arise.

Any attempt to automate this process is strongly discouraged.
